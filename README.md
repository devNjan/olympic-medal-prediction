# Olympic Medals Prediction

# In this project, I used machine learning to predict how many medals a country will win in the upcoming Olympic Games based on historical data. The goal was to explore factors that influence Olympic success, such as the number of athletes and a country’s previous performance.
Objective

# The main goal of this project was to:

    Predict the number of medals a country will win in future Olympic Games.
    Explore how historical data (such as the number of athletes and past medal counts) relates to a country's Olympic performance.

# Project Steps

I followed these key steps to complete the project:

Form a Hypothesis: I started by thinking about the problem—whether the number of athletes and past performances could help predict future success.

Find and Explore the Data: I worked with an Olympic dataset, analyzing the information available to determine which features might be important for the prediction.

Reshape the Data: I needed to transform the raw data into a format that would work better for machine learning. This involved processing the athlete-level data to create team-level data.

Clean the Data: I cleaned the data by handling missing values and outliers to ensure it was ready for modeling.

Pick an Error Metric: To measure how well the model was performing, I chose Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which tells us how far off the predictions were, on average.

Split the Data: I divided the dataset into two parts: a training set to train the model and a test set to evaluate its performance.

Train a Model: I used a simple Linear Regression model to predict the number of medals. Linear Regression was chosen because it's easy to understand and works well with this kind of problem.

# Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

    machine_learning.ipynb: This is the main notebook where the model is built, the data is cleaned, and the predictions are made.
    data_prep.ipynb: This notebook is used to process and prepare the data. It transforms the original athlete-level data into team-level data.

#Data Sources

The dataset used in this project comes from historical Olympic Games data. The two key datasets are:

    teams.csv: Contains data about the teams (countries) and their performance in the Olympics.
    athlete_events.csv: Contains individual athlete-level data, which I used to generate team-level data for the project.

# Key Insights

Here are some important takeaways from the project:

    Key Features: The number of athletes a country sends and its past medal counts were found to be the most important predictors for how many medals a country would win.

    Model Choice: I used Linear Regression, which is a simple and easy-to-understand machine learning model. It works well for predicting continuous values (like the number of medals).

    Model Performance: The model's predictions were, on average, off by about 3.30 medals, meaning it was fairly accurate but not perfect.

    Error Analysis: For some countries, like the USA, the model's predictions were significantly off. This indicates that the model could be improved for these extreme cases, and more advanced models might perform better.

# Future Enhancements

There are several ways to improve this project:

    Use More Complex Models: Models like Decision Trees or Random Forests could improve prediction accuracy, especially for countries with extreme performance variations.

    Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation would allow me to test the model on different subsets of the data and check its performance more robustly.

    Add More Features: I could include more data points, such as the age of athletes, the events attended, or historical performance trends, to make the model even more accurate.
