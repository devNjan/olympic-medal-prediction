Olympic Medals Prediction: A Beginner's Machine Learning Project
Overview

In this project, I used machine learning to predict how many medals a country will win in future Olympic Games based on historical data. The goal was to explore factors that influence Olympic success, such as the number of athletes and a country’s previous performance.
Objective

The main goals of this project were:

    Predict the number of medals a country will win in future Olympic Games.
    Explore how historical data (such as the number of athletes and past medal counts) relates to a country's Olympic performance.

Project Steps

I followed these key steps to complete the project:

    Form a Hypothesis:
        I started by thinking about the problem and considering whether factors like the number of athletes and previous medal counts could help predict future success.

    Find and Explore the Data:
        I worked with an Olympic dataset, analyzing the data to determine which features might be important for the prediction. This included examining country performance, number of athletes, and historical medal counts.

    Reshape the Data:
        Some data transformations were necessary. I reshaped the original athlete-level data into team-level data to make it more appropriate for prediction.

    Clean the Data:
        I cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing any outliers, and ensuring that the dataset was in a usable format for machine learning.

    Pick an Error Metric:
        I chose Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the error metric. This metric tells us how far off the predictions are, on average, from the actual results.

    Split the Data:
        I split the dataset into a training set (to train the model) and a test set (to evaluate the model’s performance). The training set consisted of data from years before 2012, and the test set contained data from 2012 and onwards.

    Train a Model:
        I used Linear Regression to predict the number of medals. Linear Regression is a simple and widely-used algorithm for predicting continuous variables like the number of medals a country will win.

Project Files

The project includes the following files:

    machine_learning.ipynb: The main notebook where the machine learning model is built, the data is processed, and predictions are made.
    data_prep.ipynb: A separate notebook for data preparation, transforming the raw athlete-level data into team-level data.

Data Sources

The data used for this project comes from historical Olympic Games data:

    teams.csv: Contains data on the teams (countries) and their performances in the Olympics.
    athlete_events.csv: Contains individual athlete-level data, which was used to generate team-level data.

You can download the datasets from Kaggle here.
Key Insights

Here are some important findings from the project:

    Key Features: The number of athletes and the previous medal counts were found to be the most important factors in predicting future medal counts.

    Model Choice: Linear Regression was chosen for its simplicity and suitability for continuous outcome predictions like medal counts.

    Model Performance: The model's predictions were, on average, off by about 3.30 medals. This means it was fairly accurate but could be improved.

    Error Analysis: For some countries, such as the USA, the model's predictions were less accurate. This suggests that more complex models may be better for handling these cases.

Future Enhancements

There are several ways the model could be improved:

    Use More Complex Models: Implementing models like Decision Trees or Random Forests could improve the prediction accuracy.

    Cross-Validation: Using k-fold cross-validation would give a better understanding of how the model performs on different subsets of the data.

    Add More Features: Including more features like the age of athletes, historical trends, or events attended could help improve the model’s accuracy.
